"""
Determine if a 9x9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the following rules:
Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Each of the 9 3x3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
The Sudoku board could be partially filled, where empty cells are filled with the character '.'.
Example 1:

Input:
[
  ["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."],
  ["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."],
  [".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."],
  ["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"],
  ["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"],
  ["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"],
  [".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."],
  [".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"],
  [".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]
]
Output: true
Example 2:

Input:
[
  ["8","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."],
  ["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."],
  [".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."],
  ["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"],
  ["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"],
  ["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"],
  [".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."],
  [".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"],
  [".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]
]
Output: false
Explanation: Same as Example 1, except with the 5 in the top left corner being
    modified to 8. Since there are two 8's in the top left 3x3 sub-box, it is invalid.

#思路：可以记录所有出现过的行、列、块的数字及相应位置，最后判断是否有重复。用set操作精简代码，可以有如下实现：
class Solution(object):
    def isValidSudoku(self, board):
        seen = []
        for i, row in enumerate(board):
            for j, value in enumerate(row):
                if value != ".":
                    seen += [(value, j), (i, value), (i//3, j//3, value)]
        return len(seen) == len(set(seen))
